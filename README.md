# Audio-Effects-Theory-Implementation-and-Application-Code
Code for [Audio Effects Theory Implementation and Application](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Effects-Theory-Implementation-Application/dp/1466560282)

You can get the origin source code in [here](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/audio_effects_textbook_code/repository).
But I encountered some error when I tried to compile the source code in JUCE 5.4.5, so I decide to rewrite the code in JUCE 5.4.5 as an exercise.
